# Vibe Pong - Project Plan

## Introduction
This project plan outlines the tasks needed to implement the requirements specified in the PRD and address the technical issues identified in the code review. The tasks are organized by priority to ensure the most critical features are implemented first.

## Development Workflow
For each feature or fix, we will follow this step-by-step workflow:

1. **Implement a small, focused change**
   - Work on one specific issue or feature at a time
   - Make minimal, incremental changes
   - Keep modifications focused on the specific task

2. **Write tests for the implemented code**
   - Create appropriate tests for the new functionality
   - Test both happy path and edge cases
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (desktop/mobile)

3. **Run the tests locally**
   - Test on local development environment first
   - Verify functionality works as expected
   - Test on multiple browsers if applicable
   - Test specifically on iOS for audio features

4. **Fix issues as needed**
   - Address any problems discovered during testing
   - Re-test after fixes are applied
   - Iterate until the functionality works correctly

5. **Push to GitHub**
   - Commit and push the changes to the repository
   - Update version numbers according to our versioning scheme

6. **Verify in production**
   - Test the deployed version on the Vercel production site
   - Verify functionality works in the production environment
   - Address any production-specific issues

7. **Document changes**
   - Update VERSION.md with details of the implemented changes
   - Add notes about any known limitations or issues

## Task Priorities
